# essential-cardano
Welcome to [the Essential Cardano list](https://github.com/nahern/essential-cardano/blob/main/essential-cardano-list.md), a comprehensive collection of [Essential Resources](https://github.com/nahern/essential-cardano/blob/main/resources.md#essential-resources) to help you learn more about Cardano. Whether you want to understand what Cardano is, learn about our mission and roadmap, or get stuck in and build on Cardano, this is the place to start. 

The essential Cardano list is designed to be a central library of materials, a one stop shop where you can find various resources for Cardano. This list includes official resources and community-generated materials. 

This is an open source repository that is initiated and overseen by myself [Niamh Ahern](https://iohk.io/en/team/niamh-ahern), [Ben O'Hanlon](https://iohk.io/en/team/ben-ohanlon), and [Tim Harrison](https://iohk.io/en/team/tim-harrison), all at IO Global. Please do not reproduce this list, but we encourage you to contribute and help us evolve it.

We would love to hear your suggestions and ideas on what else we could include and how we can grow this list. Please get in touch with us and raise a PR with new suggestions and additions to enhance our list and we will be in touch.
