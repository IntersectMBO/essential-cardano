# The Essential Cardano List #

‘One list to rule them all...’

Welcome to the Essential Cardano List, a comprehensive collection of resources to help you learn more about Cardano. Whether you want to understand what Cardano is, learn about our mission and roadmap, or get stuck in and build on Cardano, this is the place to start. 

The Essential Cardano list is designed to be a central library of materials, a one stop shop where you can find various resources for Cardano. This list includes official resources and community-generated materials. It is open source and we hope that you can help us to grow and fine tune this list to make it even better. We encourage you to add to this list by raising a PR in the repo with suggestions and new additions to enhance our list. 
How to contribute

This is an open source repository so we would love to hear your suggestions and ideas on what else we could include here. Please get in touch with us and raise a PR with new inclusions. This repository is managed by Ben O'Hanlon, Niamh Ahern, and Tim Harrison, all at IO Global. Please do not reproduce this list, but feel free to contribute and help us evolve it.

Exploring stake pools
IOHK has developed a stake pool metadata aggregation server (SMASH) to provide the community with a list of verified stake pools with valid metadata. Smash is integrated with the Daedalus wallet, and users can see a list of valid stake pools in the delegation center tab. 

You can also explore stake pools using these tools:
